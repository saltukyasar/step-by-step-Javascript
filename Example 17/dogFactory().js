//Write a function, dogFactory(). It should:

//have 3 parameters: name, breed, and weight (in that order)
//expect name and breed to be strings
//expect weight to be a number
//return an object
//have each of those parameters as keys on the returned object returned with the values of the arguments that were passed in
dogFactory('Joe', 'Pug', 27)
// Should return { name: 'Joe', breed: 'Pug', weight: 27 }

2.
//Add getters and setters for each of the three properties and change the property names to have an underscore prepended.


3.
//Add two methods to your object: .bark() which returns ‘ruff! ruff!’ and .eatTooManyTreats() which should increment the weight property by 1.

// Final solution:
const dogFactory = (name, breed, weight) => {
    return {
        _name: name,
        _breed: breed,
        _weight: weight,
